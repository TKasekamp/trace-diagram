                        the
                        measurement of optical radiant power. It uses the electrical substitution technique, whereby the
                        optical power incident on an absorbing cavity is compared with the electrical power required to
                        heat
                        the cavity to the same temperature. For the optical input NPL uses a Krypton Ion tuneable laser
                        producing beams of radiation at single wavelengths that are focused to under-fill the cryogenic
                        radiometer’s aperture. High Tc superconducting leads to the cavity heater ensure true
                        equivalence of

                            super black. The design of the cavity in combination with operation at helium temperatures
                            ensures an optimal response to incoming radiation. The cavity is isolated from fluctuations

                            the cold head of the cooler by a reference block maintained at a constant temperature. The
                            accuracy of the system is further enhanced by operating the cavity within an isothermal
                            shield.
