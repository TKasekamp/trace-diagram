                <div class="description" style="color: #333">NPL's cryogenic radiometer is the primary standard for the
                    measurement of optical radiant power. It uses the electrical substitution technique, whereby the
                    optical power incident on an absorbing cavity is compared with the electrical power required to heat
                    the cavity to the same temperature. For the optical input NPL uses a Krypton Ion tuneable laser
                    producingbeams of radiation at single wavelengths that are focused to under-fill the cryogenic
                    radiometerâ€™s aperture. High Tc superconducting leads to the cavity heater ensure true equivalence of
                    electrical and optical power.</p>
                    <p>The cavity is made of electroformed copper to reduce its mass and is coated internally with NPL
                        super black. The design of the cavity in combination with operation at helium temperatures
                        ensures an optimal response to incoming radiation. The cavity is isolated from fluctuations in
                        the cold head of the cooler by a reference block maintained at a constant temperature. The
                        accuracy of the system is further enhanced by operating the cavity within an isothermal shield.
